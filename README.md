# Pushdown Automata using queues
A Pushdown Automaton (PDA) is an abstract computational model that extends finite automata by using a stack as memory. In this project, we model a PDA using queues and visualize its transitions using the Graphviz library.

**Features**  
* Validation of Input Strings: Simulate the PDA for a given input string and validate if it belongs to the language.  
* Visualization: Graphically visualize the state transitions using Graphviz.  
* Interactive Interface: A Streamlit-based interactive interface to input strings and visualize transitions in real-time.
